# Password-Generator
My first python project! A simple password generator!/n
This genereator allows a user to make selections for a random password./n
By default the password length will be 12 and it will include special characters./n
The user has the option to choose a custom length for the password and ommit the special characters if they only want upper or lowercase letters. /n
